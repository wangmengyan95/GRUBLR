GRUMBLR is a nanoblogging system, an interactive web application with user registration and authentication, email integration for user verification, photo uploading & sharing, search, and quasi-real-time updates. I independently implemented the UI framework with HTML, CSS, JQuery,
Javascript, Bootstrap and developed the backend of the webiste with Python and Django.
